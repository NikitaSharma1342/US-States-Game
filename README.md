# How to run

In this states game, the player need to guess all the 50 states of the U.S.A. As soon as the player runs the code a window with the political map of USA and a dialogue box asking for the names of the states opens.

For each state name the player provides, if it is correct then the correct place in the map will be labelled with the states name, and if it is inorrect this process wont happen. If in case the player wants to exit the game in the middle, then the player needs to type exit.

The names that the player was unable to answer will be stored in a csv file named states_to_learn.csv. Every time player plays the game, states_to_learn.csv will be updated.
